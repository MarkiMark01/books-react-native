Developed a full-featured online bookstore available on mobile (React Native) platforms, with built-in user authentication. The application allows users to browse a catalog of books, view detailed descriptions, and manage a shopping cart. Authorized users can add books to their cart, seamlessly navigate between internal pages, and proceed with purchases. The project includes a fully responsive design and supports multilingual functionality, ensuring a consistent user experience across both platforms.
Technologies used for development include: JavaScript, React, Redux (Toolkit), HTML, SCSS, and Responsive Web Design with language switching support.
